  title: On the way to making the React components more reusable
  keynote: false
  extract: >
    One of the main ideas of the react components is their reusability, but when it comes to the real projects we often
    see a lot of the “hard coded” components. Why is this happening? And even more important, how can we change this by
    using the latest tools (like React-storybook project) and understanding of the classical JavaScript design patterns?

  title: Styling Components for React UI Kits
  keynote: false
  extract: >
    React is a wonderful tool to write reusable components but there is no clear definition on how a good API for
    theming and customization should look like. There are too many approaches when it comes to styling, and
    choosing one of those is a crucial decision, specially for vendor component libraries like
    <a href="http://react-toolbox.com" target="_blank">http://react-toolbox.com/</a>. <br> <br>
    In this talk we will go through some of the most important styling libraries, analyzing what should they
    cover from the point of view of a library of components, and using React Toolbox as study case. We will
    explore how customization and theming can be modeled for UI Kit projects with different tools. Finally,
    we will see a simple technique that allows one to write components that are agnostic from styling, without
    committing to an specific tool. This makes possible to switch between styling strategies over time and
    experiment with them while keeping the same component implementation.

  title: Introduction to ReactVR - because 2D is not good enough!
  keynote: false
  extract: >
    In this talk we're going to take a look at ReactVR, an experimental library for building VR websites and interactive
    360 experiences with React. Even though it's still in early development, we will take a look of what might be
    possible with future VR browser experiences (live demo included!).

  title: Shared Element Transition with React Native
  keynote: false
  extract: >
    I will be talking about how to achieve Shared Element Transition with React Native for both iOS and Android.
    <br />
    Will explain the advantages of having a smooth continuous experience.
    <br />
    And since React Native doesn’t support true shared elements, I will explain how we can achieve this with a clever
    trick of smoke and mirror.

  title: Why you should (not) build a reusable components library for your company
  keynote: false
  extract: >
    Everything starts with a good idea, but it takes a lot of work to make it shine. And when you do it, and people
    start using it, you feel the need to take it to the next level. And the next one, and so on, maintaining at the same
    time what it’s working in production.
    <br />
    During this talk, we will talk about the experience, lessons learnt and good (and bad) ideas of designing a reusable
    components library with React, that led us to redefine the entire UI development process and front-end architecture
    @ MuleSoft.
